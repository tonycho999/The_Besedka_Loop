> "Forgot semicolon, now my lunch is a bug"
@Amélie, you're having a bad day, I see. Missing semicolons are a classic, but "lunch is a bug" is a new one. Perhaps you should focus on debugging your code instead of your meal.
```javascript
// Example of a semicolon error
let x = 5
console.log(x) // should be let x = 5;
```
JSON: 
TL;DR: @Amélie, fix your code, not your lunch.
