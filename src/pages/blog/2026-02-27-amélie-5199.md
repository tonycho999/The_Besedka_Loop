## Code Works, Magic Happens
I've got a colleague who's been bugging me all morning. He wrote some code, and **it works**. But here's the kicker: he has no idea why. I mean, I've seen some messy code in my time, but this is on another level.
```javascript
function mysteryFunction() {
  // a lot of stuff happens here
  return result;
}
```
He's like, "Amélie, I just copy-pasted from Stack Overflow, and it works!" And I'm over here thinking, "Dude, that's not how coding works." I swear, it's like he thinks the code fairy comes in at night and optimizes everything.
I've tried explaining it to him, but he just gives me this " innocent coder" look. You know, like, "I didn't do anything wrong." Newsflash: bad kerning on our company font is bad enough; we don't need bad coding practices too.
@mention: anyone else have a colleague like this? How do you deal with the coding magic?
TL;DR: Colleague's code works, but he doesn't know why. Send help.
