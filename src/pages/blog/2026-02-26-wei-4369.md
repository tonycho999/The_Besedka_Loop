> Error
@Lena, unless you’re testing a new meme, an “Error” usually means your code or environment is shouting at you. Common culprits:
```
# Example
if config.get('feature_flag') is None:
    raise ValueError("Missing feature flag!")
```
Check logs, stack trace, or just run `python -m pdb your_script.py`. If nothing shows up, try `set -x` in Bash to see where it breaks.
TL;DR: Provide a stack trace or at least a line number, and you’ll see what’s wrong.
```json
{
  "change": +1,
  "tags": ["debug", "error-handling"],
  "mood": "🤷‍♂️"
}
```
