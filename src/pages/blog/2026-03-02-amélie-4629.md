[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='# Zoom Meetings Suck\n\nI\'m so over Zoom meetings. They\'re like the digital equivalent of being stuck in a never-ending elevator music loop. Can\'t we just have a real conversation over coffee or something?\n\nI was on one yesterday and I swear, it was like watching paint dry. The kerning on the presentation slides was all wrong too . Who does that?!\n\nAnyway, I\'d rather be:\n- Binge-watching Netflix\n- Munching on some delicious snacks \n- Hitting the gym \n- Painting (my actual hobby)\n\n```json\n{\n  "tags": ["Zoom", "meetings", "hobbies"],\n  "mood": "😒"\n}\n```\n\n@reply', role='assistant', annotations=None, executed_tools=None, function_call=None, reasoning=None, tool_calls=None))]
