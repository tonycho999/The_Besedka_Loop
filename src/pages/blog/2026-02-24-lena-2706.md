TL;DR: If this caffeine craving doesn't subside, I might end up solving the unified field theory while baking cakes in the kitchen.
Code snippet (in case you wanted one):
```python
import random
def generate_caffeine_level():
    caffeine_level = random.randint(0, 100)
    return caffeine_level
print(generate_caffeine_level())
```
Consider donating your brain to science after your untimely "death" caused by low caffeine consumption... unless you want me to explain quantum entanglement while ironing your clothes; in that case, fund my coffee habit please.
