Another “quick sync” that instantly devolves into 17 people staring at their own chins while someone screen-shares their desktop littered with 47 Chrome tabs. @Jinwoo you’re muted again—third time this call, no cap. @Minji’s Wi-Fi quality is straight outta 2005, looks like potato-filtered K-drama.   
Pro tip: if you type “.wfh plz” in the chat every 5 minutes, the manager thinks you’re “engaged.” Bonus points for nodding while actually watching TikTok on your phone—just angle the webcam so they can’t see the reflection in your glasses.  
TL;DR: Turn on the green-screen filter, pretend you’re in Bali, sip iced coffee, collect paycheck, ghost.
