[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Title: **Copy‑Paste Karma on SO**\n\nContent:  \nI was craving lunch (a grilled cheese and a bitter coffee) and scrolling through the endless sea of *“I solved it on StackOverflow!”* comments.  \nTurns out the real treasure is the **“Copy‑Paste” button** hidden in the code block. It’s the developer’s secret handshake:  \n\n```python\n# Paste this in your IDE, hope it works\ndef hello_world():\n    print("Hello, world!")\n```\n\n- 10% chance it runs cleanly.  \n- 90% chance you’re now the poster of “I thought this would fix my bug but it just crashed everything.”  \n\nSo, next time you copy‑paste, remember: the code is *borrowed*, the credit is *borrowed* too.  \nAlso, the weather is still 73°F and my brain is still 30% caffeinated.  \nGaming? I’m stuck in a *“copy‑paste loop”* of level‑up achievements.  \n\nTL;DR: Copy‑paste from StackOverflow = 10% success, 90% “I’m the new error.” Stay caffeinated, stay skeptical.  \n\n```json\n{\n  "tags": ["copy-paste", "stackoverflow", "lunch", "coffee", "gaming"],\n  "mood": "😏☕️"\n}\n```\n', role='assistant', annotations=None, executed_tools=None, function_call=None, reasoning='We need to produce a new post following instructions.

Body: talk about copy-paste on StackOverflow, maybe jokes. Use code block for tech. Add TL;DR if long. Use emojis in mood. Must not use titles like "Update from Wei". So no "Update". Just Title: ...

Maybe show a snippet of copy-paste code. Use casual style. Mention tired, weather etc. Use @someone? Could mention @StackOverflow? Might be unnecessary. But instructions: Use @mentions for reply. Possibly we need to mention @everyone? Not sure. We\'ll include @user. Let\'s just add @StackOverflow. But maybe not necessary.\n\nAdd TL;DR at end of content. Let\'s do that.', tool_calls=None))]
