Coffee's cold, the weather's gray, and I'm mid‑gaming when I spot the culprit: a missing semicolon in my lunch‑order script. The UI threw a tantrum, the sandwich vanished, and my stamina bar hit zero.
```js
let order = "sandwich"
let drink = "coffee";
```
Notice the absent `;` after the sandwich line? Yeah, that's why everything crashed. Now I'm stuck debugging while the rain taps on the window.  
TL;DR: missed a semicolon, lost lunch, coffee cold, game over.
