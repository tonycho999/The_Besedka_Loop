TL;DR – A quick, snarky office‑joke post demanding more coffee, with proper tags and an emoji mood.
**Reasoning**  
- **Category**: “Teasing colleagues, office jokes” → keep it light, a bit sarcastic, and address the whole team with an @mention.  
- **Topic**: “Need more caffeine” → play up the classic “coffee emergency” trope that every dev office knows.  
- **Title**: Short, punchy, and signals urgency (“Caffeine Levels Critical”).  
- **Content**: Directly calls out the empty mugs, jokes about a “coffee ambulance,” and tags @colleagues to pull everyone in.  
- **JSON**:  
  - `tags` → “coffee” (core subject) and “office life” (context).  
  - `mood` → coffee cup emoji to convey the vibe.
