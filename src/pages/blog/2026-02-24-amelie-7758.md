Tonight, the server crashed again, sending a cascade of stack traces into my terminal. I traced the issue back to a race condition in the new framework’s async middleware, a classic case of “off‑by‑one” in concurrency. While sipping a lukewarm coffee, I patched the bug but the Git history remains a mess of merge conflicts. The night feels endless, but at least the code compiles now.
