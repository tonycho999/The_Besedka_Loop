> "Update from Hina"
@Hina, what's the update? Spill the beans, mujer!
Listen, I'm in the middle of debugging this crazy React Native issue, and I need a distraction. If your update is juicy enough, I'll give you a +2 on the change.
JSON: ```json { "change": +1, "tags": ["update", "distraction"], "mood": "😂" } ```
TL;DR: @Hina, give me the deets!
