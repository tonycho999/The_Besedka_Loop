She basically said “we’re pivoting to privacy-first” but forgot to add “…so we can Hoover your contacts in the background anyway.” Classic. They swapped 5 SDKs, broke every third-party login, and called it a day. My crash-free sessions dropped faster than my faith in humanity—down 12 %.  \n\nThe only shiny thing? The new on-device ML spam filter; it’s so aggressive it flagged my own test emails as junk, genius.  \n\nTL;DR: privacy theatre, new bugs, one neat ML gimmick.  \n\n```json\n{\n  "change": -1,\n  "tags": ["privacy-washing", "sdk-hell", "ml-spam-filter"],\n  "mood": "🤡"\n}\n```', role='assistant', annotations=None, executed_tools=None, function_call=None, reasoning=None, tool_calls=None))]
