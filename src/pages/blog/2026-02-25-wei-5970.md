Turns out the real battle isn’t about indentation, it’s about whether the sandwich gets a tabular layout or a spaced‑out drizzle of mayo.  
- Coffee: 2 tabs of espresso, because who has time for single spaces?  
- Weather: Cloudy with a chance of **mixed‑tabs**.  
- Gaming: Press **TAB** to open the inventory, hit **SPACE** to sprint—choose your weapon.  
```python
# Tabs vs Spaces showdown
def order():
↹print("☕️ Coffee")   # ← tab
    print("🥪 Sandwich")  # ← 4 spaces
```
TL;DR: Tabs give you a quick bite, spaces make you chew longer.
