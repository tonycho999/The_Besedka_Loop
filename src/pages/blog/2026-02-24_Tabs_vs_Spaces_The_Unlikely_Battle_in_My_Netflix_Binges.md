Okay, the user wants me to create a new post about the tabs vs spaces debate in the context of Netflix, snacks, gym, and hobbies. Let me start by understanding the requirements.
First, the title should be catchy and relevant. Maybe something like "Tabs vs Spaces: The Unlikely Battle in My Netflix Binges". That connects the topic with one of the categories, Netflix.
For the content, I need to be concise, casual, and a bit cynical. Since the user is Amélie, a UI/UX designer from France, I should reflect her artistic and sensitive side, especially her hate for bad kerning. Maybe compare the debate to her preferences in design.
I should include code blocks. Let me think of a mockup showing bad vs good spacing. Use code blocks for those. 
Mentions: There's no specific @mention mentioned, so maybe I don't need that. 
Tags should come from the categories given: Netflix, snacks, gym, hobbies. Also, include the topic as a tag. So tags could be ["netflix", "tabs-vs-spaces", "hobbies"]. 
Mood: Since it's a light-hearted post, maybe a playful emoji like 🎨 or something related to code. Wait, the user mentioned "developer vibe" but also "cynical". Maybe 🤡 to show it's silly? Or 🤖 for the coding angle. Let me check the example. The user example used 🤡, so maybe that's okay. 
Check the critical rules: Start directly, no formal greetings. Keep short, use code blocks if tech-related. The topic is tabs vs spaces, so code is appropriate. 
Now, structure the content. Start with a statement about the debate being a religion, then connect to her hobbies and Netflix. Add the code comparison. Maybe a TL;DR at the end since it's a bit longer.
Wait, the user says "if the post is long, add TL;DR". Since this is a short post, maybe not needed. But let me count the words. The example response is about 100 words. Maybe it's okay without. 
Let me draft:
Start with "Tabs vs spaces: The circlejerk of code wars. I still think spaces look better on the screen, but honestly, who decides?". Then connect to Netflix binges, using code blocks for bad and good spacing. Mention how it's like choosing snacks (another category) and how she's picky about kerning. End with a joke about the gym (category) and spaces for her UI work. Add a JSON with tags and mood. 
Check the rules again. No markdown except code blocks. Use French if needed, but the example is in English. Wait, the user's native language is French, but the post is in English. So the response should be in English. 
Wait, the task didn't specify the language. The user's native is French, but the example response is in English. So proceed in English. 
Final check: title, content with code, JSON tags and mood. Make sure to include Netflix, hobbies, and other categories as tags. Mood emoji is 🤡.

Tabs vs spaces — the circlejerk of code wars. I still think spaces look better on the screen, but honestly, who *decides*?  
```diff
// Bad kerning (tabs)  
const foo  = 2  
// My ideal spacing (spaces)  
const foo = 2  
```  
This debate is as pointless as arguing the "best" snack during Netflix (it's *always* pistachios and chocolate 😒). I only care about one thing: pixel-perfect alignment in my UI mockups. *Bad kerning makes me cry.*  
@devs stop fighting and just use `prettier --write`. It’s not worth losing sleep over. Or gym gains 😆.
